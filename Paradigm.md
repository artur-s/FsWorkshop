# Why Functional Programming?

## What is it?

    - Separation of data and logic vs. object with mutable state
    - Pure functions and immutable _data types_ vs classes
    - Composition of functions
    - Composition of data structures


## Why it matters?

    - I have been programming for so long without worrying about Functional Programming. (What has changed?)
    (- Immutability)
    - It is [simpler and safer](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/is-your-language-unreasonable/)
    - Pure functions (and also pure data structures) are easier to compose
    - Pure functions (transformations) and imutable data is simple to reason about
    - modeling side-effects with data structures (DSL's), transformed by pure functions and interpreted at the edge of the application.
