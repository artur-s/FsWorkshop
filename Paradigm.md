# Why Functional Programming?

## Why it is worth learning FP?

    - Disruptive change in software development. Functional features are invading imperative languages like C# (e.g. LINQ), C++, Java.
    - Knowing functional paradigm helps writing more robust code in imperative languages.
    - Multicore revolution. OO paradigm does not help you with concurrency and parallelism.
    - Complexity of software is growing and shows limits of scalability of imperative design.

## What is it?

    - Separation of data and logic vs. object with mutable state
    - Pure functions and immutable _data types_ vs classes
    - Composition of functions
    - Composition of data structures

## Why it matters?

    - Pure functions (and also pure data structures) are easier to compose
    - Pure functions (data transformations) and immutable data is simple to reason about
    - modeling side-effects with data structures (DSL's), transformed by pure functions and interpreted at the edge of the application.
    - It is [simpler and safer](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/is-your-language-unreasonable/)
