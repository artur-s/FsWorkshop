#### FSharp Workshop plan


  - Purpose: Help iQ developers switch to F# - the best language available for .NET. Show adventages of FP paradigm over OO.
  - Paradigm: 
      - Why FP is better paradigm than others, like OO? 
  	    - See Bartosz Milewski's intro post
  	    - Check [5 good reasons to move to F# video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0BB3lU_qr4)
  	- Basics: 
      - function signature
      - currying, partial application ([1](https://youtu.be/-0BB3lU_qr4?t=455))
      - pipelining (|>) 
      - f. composition
      - type system
        - ADTs: record [1](https://youtu.be/-0BB3lU_qr4?t=623), discriminated union
        - object expressions
        - (class, interface)
  	  - expression based:
        - see: F# Deep Dive book (T.Petricek chapter) 
        - [Expressions vs Statements in DevJoy post](http://www.devjoy.com/2014/12/decorating-immutable-christmas-trees/)
      - type inference
  	  - Pattern matching: match, let, active patterns
      - exercises: [Bowling kata](https://github.com/artur-s/PlaygroundAndKatas/blob/3cf7fe2aac4dd307bc7a235a9e7401df4f5b0c3a/MiscProjects/src/MiscKatas/Bowling.fs)?
      - also check the Why OO matters post for hard parts of expression-based langs
  	- Auto-generalization: parametricity, 
  	- Recursion and beyond:
  		- Recursive types and functions and immutability [OCaml99](https://ocaml.org/learn/tutorials/99problems.html)
  		- Tail recursion
  		- Abstracting recursion: folds, catamorphism (Scott's blog)
  	- (Easy does not mean simple. Rich Hickey: Simple made easy)
  - Composability
    - Effectful computations with computation expressions: `result`, `async`, `query` (, `cloud`)
    - Dependency rejection
  - DDD/ Domain modelling:
  	- ADT, algebra on types, Better domain logic representation in type system : _Why F# system with ADTs is great for domain modelling?_
  	- show [implementation of know CleanCode example in F#](https://functionalsoftware.net/fsharp-rewrite-of-a-fully-refactored-csharp-clean-code-example-612/) (find in notes), [DevJoy blog post](http://www.devjoy.com/2017/02/reading-f/)
    - Scott's Modeling domain workshop from OpenFSharp
  	- API -> DSL (with custom operators) - check Will Smith talk from OpenFSharp
  - Best practices: 
  	- explicit types on API level, implicit/type inference on implementation
	- (...)
  - (type providers, show CSV, EF or Swagger)
  - Use #funprog channel for communication (to make it more alive)
	- prepare questions to engage (conversations)
  - feedback: google survey?
